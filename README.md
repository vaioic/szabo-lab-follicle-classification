# Ovarian follicle classification

This project contains an image analysis pipeline to identify and classify images of
ovaries by development. The original images were collected using an Aperio slide scanner.

## Usage

### Setup and installation

#### Using uv (Recommended)

This project uses [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) to manage virtual environments and dependencies. 

1. Install ``uv``
    * **macOS or Linux:** ``curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh``
    * **Windows:** ``powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"``
    
    To check if you have ``uv`` installed, open a terminal and run ``uv --version``.

2. Clone the repository
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:vaioic/szabo-lab-follicle-classification.git
   cd szabo-lab-follicle-classification
   ```

3. Sync the environment (this will setup the correct virtual environment and dependencies)
   ```bash
   uv sync
   ```

4. Run the analysis
   ```bash
   uv run analysis/analysis_script.py
   ```

#### Using venv and pip

1. Clone the repository
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:vaioic/szabo-lab-follicle-classification.git
   cd szabo-lab-follicle-classification
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```

3. Activate the environment
   ```bash
   # macOS/Linux
   source ./venv/bin/activate

   # Windows (PowerShell)
   .\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
   ```

4. Install the repository as an editable module
   ```bash
   python -m pip install -e .
   ```

5. Run the analysis script
   ```bash
   python -m analysis.analysis_script

   # or
   python analysis/analysis_script.py
   ```
